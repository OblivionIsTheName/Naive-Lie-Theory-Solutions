Here are some tips on how to use this solution:
1. Please have the textbook opened with you when you go through the solutions, as I won't copy the problem statements. I am lazy.
2. I make mistakes. Please let me know via creating a new issue, and we can discuss!
3. Some of the problems are calculation-and-manipulation-heavy. Please don't expect me to write step-by-step solution, as it's all boring work and looks bad. I will provide verbal guide instead.
