Hello there! This project contains my solutions to all exercises in the textbook Naive Lie Theory by John Stillwell. 

This is a great textbook for ambitious lower-grade undergraduates who want to explore algebra and geometry with a less mechanical and more intuitive approach. I recommend anyone with some group basics to read this book.

I will write solutions into PDF documents in Latex for each subsection of the book. If necessary, I will include some notes to help the reader better understand or fill some gaps in the textbook. This will likely happen since Chapter 2.

Here are some tips on how to use this solution:
1. Please have the textbook opened with you when you go through the solutions, as I won't copy the problem statements. I am lazy.
2. I make mistakes. Please let me know via creating a new issue, and we can discuss!
3. Some of the problems are calculation-and-manipulation-heavy. Please don't expect me to write step-by-step solution, as it's all boring work and looks bad. I will provide verbal guide instead.
